        <h1>About Saloni Pawar</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Saloni Pawar</strong>. I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">India(Mumbai)</a>. 
        I love to <em>travel</em> and explore new places. Please <a href="https://curlytales.com/here-are-indias-best-destinations-for-every-month-of-the-year/"> Click here </a> for travel suggestions across India. I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again.
         Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news. </p>
